Emojify in C 😃⚾🍴
Welcome to Emojify in C 🎉! This project ports the original Emojify project to C, running on GCC in a CLI environment 🚀. It reads labels from Emojify_Y_train.csv 📊, sentences from emojify_train_x.csv 📜, trains an MLP to predict emojis 🧠, and outputs results to output.txt 📝 with a confusion matrix and accuracy 📈. In --train mode, it creates weights.txt with emoji-labeled weights for educational readability.
What Does It Do? 🤔

Reads Data 📖:
Emojify_Y_train.csv: 132 labels (0–4, space or comma-separated) 📊.
emojify_train_x.csv: 132 quoted sentences 📜.
glove.6B.50d.txt: GloVe embeddings (~400,000 words) 📚.


Maps Emojis 😊:
0: ❤️ (Heart)
1: ⚾ (Baseball)
2: 😃 (Grinning Face)
3: 😞 (Disappointed Face)
4: 🍴 (Fork and Knife)


Trains MLP 🧠:
50 input (GloVe) → 32 hidden (sigmoid) → 5 output (softmax).
Creates weights.txt with emoji labels (e.g., ❤️ Heart) in --train mode.


Predicts Emojis 🔮:
Averages GloVe vectors, applies MLP, predicts emojis.


Outputs Results 📄:
output.txt and console: 132 sentences, labels, emojis, predictions, matrix, accuracy 🎯.



How Weights Map to Emojis 🧮

MLP Structure:
w1 (50x32): Maps 50D GloVe vectors to 32 hidden units (not emoji-specific).
w2 (32x5): Maps 32 hidden units to 5 emojis. Each column corresponds to an emoji:
Column 0: ❤️ (Heart)
Column 1: ⚾ (Baseball)
Column 2: 😃 (Grinning Face)
Column 3: 😞 (Disappointed Face)
Column 4: 🍴 (Fork and Knife)


b1 (32): Hidden biases (not emoji-specific).
b2 (5): Output biases, one per emoji in the same order as above.


weights.txt Format:# Input to hidden weights (50x32)
0.100000 -0.200000 ... (50 rows of 32 values)
# Hidden to output weights (32x5) with emoji labels
0.050000 -0.150000 0.250000 -0.350000 0.450000 # Hidden 0 to emojis: ❤️ (Heart) ⚾ (Baseball) 😃 (Grinning Face) 😞 (Disappointed Face) 🍴 (Fork and Knife)
...
# Hidden biases (32)
0.000000 ... (32 values)
# Output biases (5) with emoji labels
0.100000 -0.200000 0.300000 -0.100000 0.400000 # Emojis: ❤️ (Heart) ⚾ (Baseball) 😃 (Grinning Face) 😞 (Disappointed Face) 🍴 (Fork and Knife)


Each row of w2 shows how a hidden unit contributes to each emoji’s score.
b2 shows the bias for each emoji’s score.



For Users: How to Use It 🖱️

Get the Files 📂:

Place Emojify_Y_train.csv and emojify_train_x.csv in EmojifiedText/.
Place glove.6B.50d.txt (~400,000 words) in data/.
Verify: ls -l EmojifiedText/Emojify_Y_train.csv EmojifiedText/emojify_train_x.csv data/glove.6B.50d.txt.


Compile 🔨:
gcc -g -o emojify_reader emojify_reader.c -lm


Run (Train Mode) 🏃:
./emojify_reader EmojifiedText/Emojify_Y_train.csv EmojifiedText/emojify_train_x.csv data/glove.6B.50d.txt --train output.txt


Trains MLP, creates weights.txt with emoji labels, and predicts.
No existing weights.txt needed; it’s generated automatically.


Run (Load Mode) 🏃:
./emojify_reader EmojifiedText/Emojify_Y_train.csv EmojifiedText/emojify_train_x.csv data/glove.6B.50d.txt --load weights.txt output.txt


Loads weights from weights.txt and predicts.


View Results 👀:

Console: Shows sentence count, training loss (if training), and predictions.
output.txt:Line 1: Sentence="never talk to me again", Label=3, Emoji=😞, Description=Disappointed Face
Predicted: Label=3, Emoji=😞, Description=Disappointed Face
...
Confusion Matrix (Actual vs Predicted):
    0  1  2  3  4
0:  5  0  0  0  0  # ❤️ (Heart)
...
Accuracy: 0.8500


weights.txt: Open in VS Code to see emoji labels with weights.



For Educators/Students: Understanding Weights 📚

Why Emojis in Weights?:
w2 and b2 are labeled with emojis (e.g., ❤️ Heart) to show which weights influence each emoji’s prediction.
Example: In w2, the value at [i][2] affects the score for 😃 (Grinning Face).


Interpreting Weights:
Positive w2[i][j] means hidden unit i increases the likelihood of emoji j.
Negative w2[i][j] decreases it.
b2[j] is a baseline score for emoji j.


Educational Tip:
Compare w2 values across emojis to see which hidden units are most influential for, e.g., 😞 vs. 😃.
Modify EPOCHS or LEARNING_RATE to experiment with training.



For Developers: How to Modify 🛠️

Adjust MLP:
Change HIDDEN_DIM (32) or EPOCHS (100) in code.
Modify LEARNING_RATE (0.01) for convergence.


Load Custom Weights:
Edit weights.txt manually, keeping emoji labels for w2 and b2.
Use --load weights.txt to test.


Add Advanced Models:
Extend forward and backward for LSTM or attention heads.



Troubleshooting 😵

Only 37 Labels Read? 🚨:
Check Emojify_Y_train.csv format (should be 132 labels, space or comma-separated):3 1 2 0 4 ...


Run and share:head -n 10 EmojifiedText/Emojify_Y_train.csv




Only 9163 GloVe Words? 🚨:
Verify glove.6B.50d.txt size (~822 MB, ~400,000 lines):wc -l data/glove.6B.50d.txt


Ensure it’s not truncated (e.g., head -n 10 data/glove.6B.50d.txt).


Fewer than 132 Sentences? 🚨:
Check emojify_train_x.csv format:'never talk to me again' 'I am proud of your achievements' ...


Run wc -l EmojifiedText/emojify_train_x.csv and share output.


Segmentation Fault? 🚨:
Run with GDB:gdb ./emojify_reader
run EmojifiedText/Emojify_Y_train.csv EmojifiedText/emojify_train_x.csv data/glove.6B.50d.txt --train output.txt
